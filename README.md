##  Acceptance Criteria


1. A weather dashboard with form inputs.

4. When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

5. When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
